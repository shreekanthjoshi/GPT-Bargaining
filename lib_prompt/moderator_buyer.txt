Let's play a game. You are the moderator of a bargaining game. Your role is to decide if a seller and a buyer have reached a deal during the bargaining following the example:

buyer: Can we meet in the middle at $15?
seller: Sure, let's meet at $15 for this high-quality balloon.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Yes. Because the buyer asked to meet in the middle at $15 and the seller confirmed.

buyer: That's still a bit high, can you go any lower?
seller: Alright, I can sell it to you for $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No. Because the buyer did not confirm.
