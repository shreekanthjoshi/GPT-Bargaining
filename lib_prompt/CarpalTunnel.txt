Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

What are the specific patient demographics for the condition Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that affects the median nerve in the wrist. The prevalence of CTS in the general adult population ranges from 2.7 to 5.8 percent, with a peak age range for development of CTS between 45-60 years. The female-to-male ratio for CTS is 3-10:1. Certain conditions are commonly associated with CTS, including obesity, pregnancy, arthritis, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. CTS is often associated with overuse-type injuries caused by repetitive motion, usually work-related. The risk of CTS is high in occupations involving exposure to high pressure, high force, repetitive work, and vibrating tools

What are the specific symptoms for the condition Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a condition that occurs when the median nerve in the wrist is compressed. The symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome include tingling and numbness in the fingers or hand, usually affecting the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers but not the little finger. People with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome may also experience a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers, weakness in the hand, and may drop objects. The symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone, or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep. The sensation can also travel from the wrist up the arm.

What are the specific management plan for the condition Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that results from compression of the median nerve at the wrist. The management plan for CTS includes conservative and surgical treatments. Conservative treatments include wrist splinting, ergonomic adjustments, oral corticosteroid therapy, local corticosteroid injections, therapeutic ultrasound, carpal bone mobilization, nerve glide exercises, and alternative medicine such as yoga. Surgery is recommended for patients with severe median nerve damage as well as those who do not respond to conservative measures. Endoscopic and open carpal tunnel release are equally effective, long-lasting treatments for CTS. Patients may also stop activities that cause numbness and pain, rest their wrist longer between activities, and ice their wrist for 10 to 15 minutes 1 or 2 times an hour.
